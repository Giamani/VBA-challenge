In the zip file you will find the vba script for Module 2 Challenge.
The script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol
Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock. 
Also the script has functionality to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".


NOTE: I was not able to upload the screenshot as is and uploded it in zip file with the vba script.
